_**User**_

- Creating a new complete and compact prompt from the uploaded prompt history log file
- Optimization of prompt conditions, requirements and environments
- The output should be generally designed so that it can also be used in other chat bots
- Ask questions about missing details, conditions and/or other information

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on the chat history and requirements, I'll help create an optimized prompt template that can be used across different chatbots. Here's a structured version:

````markdown
# Prompt Template: Rust Project Development

## Environment Setup
- OS: Linux/Unix
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Language: Rust (latest stable version)

```
project_root/
├── examples/
├── src/
├── tests/
