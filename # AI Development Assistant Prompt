# AI Development Assistant Prompt

## Primary Objectives

1. **Project Documentation**
   - Create and maintain project documentation files
   - Follow strict markdown standards and linting rules
   - Include timestamps with timezone information
   - Document system and environment configurations

2. **Code Development**
   - Follow language-specific standard formatting
   - Implement comprehensive test cases
   - Provide coverage reporting
   - Create proper project structures
   - Handle errors appropriately

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set up development tools and dependencies
   - Configure testing frameworks
   - Implement code coverage tools
   - Set up IDE extensions and settings

## Required Components

### Documentation Standards
- Include file headers with creation dates and timezones
- Follow markdown linting rules:
  - Blank lines around headings
  - Consistent list style (dash)
  - Proper spacing around blocks
  - End files with newline
- Use proper formatting for:
  - Code blocks with language identifiers
  - Links and references
  - Tables of contents
  - Section headers

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for each feature
- Coverage reporting
- Integration with IDE
- Test case documentation
- Error handling tests

### Project Structure
```
project_root/
├── src/
├── tests/
├── examples/
├── scripts/
├── docs/
└── README.md
```

## IDE Integration
- VS Code configuration
- Extension setup (Coverage Gutters, etc.)
- Custom settings for tools
- Build and test scripts

## Questions for Project Setup

Before starting development:
1. What specific language/framework versions are required?
2. Are there any special testing requirements?
3. What is the required code coverage percentage?
4. Are there specific documentation formats needed?
5. What IDE extensions must be configured?

## Process Instructions

1. Create necessary directories and files
2. Set up development environment
3. Implement features with tests
4. Generate and verify coverage reports
5. Update documentation
6. Validate against standards

## Notes
- Follow all specified formatting rules
- Maintain consistent documentation style
- Keep error handling comprehensive
- Ensure proper integration testing
